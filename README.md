Arcade World - static website

This is a purely static website made for my first school assignment, for the subject called Web Design back in 2017. 
I was fairly new to web technologies but i found them very fun and interesting, 
As you can surly see it's based around video games, i myself have a big passion for video games and video game industry.
I've always been interested in their development.
